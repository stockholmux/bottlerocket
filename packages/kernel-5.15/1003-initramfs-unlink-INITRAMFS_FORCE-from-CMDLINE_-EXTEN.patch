Subject: [PATCH] initramfs: unlink INITRAMFS_FORCE from CMDLINE_{EXTEND,FORCE}

The motivation given in cff75e0b6fe83 for tying INITRAMFS_FORCE to
either of CMDLINE_{EXTEND,FORCE} was that these options imply an
inflexible bootloader, and that overriding the initramfs image would
also only be necessary for inflexible bootloaders.

However, with the advent of Boot Config support, distributions that do
not normally use an initramfs may still want to allow an "initrd" to be
passed by the bootloader in order to accept boot configuration data. In
such cases, the CMDLINE_{EXTEND,FORCE} options are not desired because
the bootloader is actually expected to control the kernel command line.

Unlinking the INITRAMFS_FORCE config option allows Boot Config data to
be passed by the bootloader while still preventing an unexpected
initramfs from overriding the built-in initramfs (if any).

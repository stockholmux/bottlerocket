# The ECS agent repository includes two CNI plugins as git submodules.  git
# archive does not include submodules, so the tarball above does not include
# the source of those plugins.  Instead, we include the CNI plugin source
# directly.
# You can get the commit SHA for the submodules for a particular ecs-agent release here:
